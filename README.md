# Stackoverflow-2020survey_analyse
This project is part of the "UDACITY Nano Degree in Data Science" program.

## Libraries
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn


## Introduction
Once a year, StackOverflow conducts a developer survey that asks for information ranging from technical and behavioral to problematic information that will help them improve the community for all developers worldwide. The 2020 questionnaire covers questions such as the developer's educational and professional background, company and job, developer's language preference, and use of StackOverflow.


## Project Motivation
Based on data provided, this project analyzed :

- the factors that Internet professionals (surveyed) value in choosing careers (with the same compensation,
benefits, and location condition)
- some basic fact about data scientists and their preferred programming language 
- frequency of overtime work in different jobs


## File Descriptions
Here is 1 notebook which shows work related to the above question. The notebook is exploratory in searching for data related to the problem shown in the notebook title. Markdown cells are used to help complete the various steps in the thinking process.


## Result
For detailed analysis of the data results, please check the [blog](https://wenjingleaf.medium.com/2020-developers-their-job-f8dbf276122e)

### 1. Main factors in choosing a career
![Q1_jobs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59653182/120085928-a34cf580-c0dc-11eb-875d-398415b1a007.png)

As it can be seen, _language and structure_, _work schedules_ and _career development opportunities_ are the most important factors for most developers.

### 2. basic fact about data scientists and their preferred programming language 
**Basic facts:**
- *About undergrand major*: The vast majority of data scientists come from the field of computer science. The other three relatively common undergraduate backgrounds are, in order, engineering discipline, mathematics or statistics, and natural science

- *About education level* : People with master's degrees and bachelor's degrees make up the majority of the population.

- *About the company that data scientists work at* : Overall, large companies and mid-sized companies seem to have relatively greater demand.

**Programming language**
The most commonly used languages are python, C, Java and SQL in order of preference

### 3. frequency of overtime work in different jobs

Frequent overtime is always more common, no matter in what profession. We also note that practitioners in the management (managers, senior executives) and sales categories are most likely to experience frequent overtime work.
